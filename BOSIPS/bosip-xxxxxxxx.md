# BOSIP Template



| BOSIP Number   | Title       | Author                                  | Status           | Type                          | Category                           | Created Date | Requires (*optional)              |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |

Above describes the suggest template of a valid BOSIP.

Note that the BOSIP Number will be assigned by an editor later after the pr has been submitted. And make sure to use an abbreviated filename same as the title field, e.g. `bosip-draft_this_is_a_abbreviated_filename.md`.

Below will describe the main content of a BOSIP.

## Simple Summary

Please do provide a simplified and straightforward explanation of the main idea of your BOSIP. You are welcomed to use graphics here if needed, but do make it simple and clear.

## Abstract

A short description of the technical issue being addressed, maybe about 200 words.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for BOSIPs that want to change the BOS protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the BOSIP solves. BOSIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

##  Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to guide implementations.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in a particular programming language. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility

All BOSIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The BOSIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. BOSIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for BOSIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other BOSIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation

The implementations must be completed before any BOSIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the BOSIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
